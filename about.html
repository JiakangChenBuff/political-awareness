                        <div style='margin:1vw;'>Our mission is to interact with young individuals by motivating them to

                            self-advocate for positive changes in their lives by providing services, such as classes,
                            seminars,
                            workshops, podcasts, a YouTube channel, and volunteering opportunities. We believe it is
                            important
                            to
                            engage
                            the youth in thoughtful conversations and discussions. Rhapsody for Youth is to make us
                            heard.
