                    <div style='margin:1vw;'>Our mission is to interact with young individuals by motivating them to
                        articulate their ideas and
                        self-advocate for positive changes in their lives by providing services, such as classes,
                        seminars,
                        workshops, podcasts, a YouTube channel, and volunteering opportunities. We believe it is
                        important
                        to
                        engage
                        the youth in thoughtful conversations and discussions. Rhapsody for Youth is to make us heard.
