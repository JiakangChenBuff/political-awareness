                <p>If you’ve ever been to the zoo, it’s more than likely that you’ve seen many animals that could once only be found across the world. Think rhinos, elephants, tigers, leopards, sea turtles, and even orangutans! Although they’re fun to watch and learn about from behind the glass exhibition window, these animals share a tragic fact: they’re all victims of poaching, a dangerous and illegal activity that threatens the wellbeing of animals across the planet.
                    What is poaching? Poaching is the illegal hunting of wild animals, often for either sport or market demand. It’s estimated by the Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network, TRAFFIC, that the trade resulting from poaching is likely worth billions of dollars. The World Bank takes this approximation further and sets it at a range of 5-23 billion dollars per year. It’s no minor matter. About 60% of elephants face their deaths at the hands of poachers - which isn’t a surprise, given the statistic that ivory hunters kill about 96 elephants daily in Africa. In South Africa alone, where the largest population of rhinos in the world reside, there was a 9000% increase in poaching between 2007 and 2014. That’s about 90 times the original rate in 2007. </p>
                <p>Illegal wildlife hunting poses a major threat to many countries in Asia and Africa. For example, there’s Botswana, which has about a third of Africa’s elephants; India, whose animals like tigers are locked in the target of poachers; and Mozambique, where lack of infrastructure and preventive legislation gives poachers the advantage in their hunts for ivory and rhino horn. It is also a problem, though to a lesser extent, in the USA and other Western countries. </p>
                <p>Modern day poaching is driven by the ever-increasing demand for wildlife products. Whether for tools, goods, or treasure, people demand access to these resources with little regard for how it affects the animals themselves. Rhino and elephant ivory remain some of the main resources trafficked today. Ivory is wanted by people across the world for a number of reasons. It has value as a luxury material, but it is also used as medicine or for its believed spiritual properties. For instance, in Vietnam there has arisen a myth that rhino horn can cure cancer. Tigers are also a frequent victim of poaching. They’re hunted for both their pelts, which are a luxury like ivory, and their bones, which are believed to have medicinal and spiritual properties by many. Tiger poaching is mostly headed by organized crime rather than individual hunters, and it brings in about 19 billion US dollars a year. Poachers even go after sea turtle eggs because they can be sold in the illegal market, and oftentimes eaten as a delicacy. According to People Not Poaching, over 90% of turtle eggs are destroyed for the wildlife trade at beaches that don’t have protective regulations against poaching. </p>
                <p>Although poaching brings in a lot of money for its participants, it comes at heavy costs for everyone else. It goes without saying that poaching destroys the environment. First, it’s killing animals at unnatural rates. Illegal wildlife hunting imbalances food webs and destabilizes ecosystems across the globe. The amur leopard, for example, is registered as critically endangered in part because of its being targeted by poachers. Second, poachers also bring nonnative species with them into regions when they’re hunting. This introduces invasive flora and fauna that further disrupt the environment and local competition. The negative impacts on diversity of wildlife in regions also affects local communities, who rely on those animals to sustain their cultures, traditions, and even general survival. </p>
