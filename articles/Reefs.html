                <p>Have you ever been scuba diving? From personal experience, I think it’s pretty breathtaking (quite literally if you inhale the saltwater) and definitely worth a shot if you ever get the chance after lockdown. In addition to the fish, scuttling crabs, and lumbering turtles, you can also view one of the ocean’s greatest masterpieces while scuba diving: coral reefs. They’re colorful, beautiful, home to thousands of tiny animals - and also dying more and more by the year. </p>
                <p>Why is this happening? </p>
                <p>To start off, let’s explain what coral reefs are exactly. Coral reefs are ocean ecosystems formed by coral polyps, small organisms related to anemone and jellyfish. When these polyps attach themselves to hard surfaces underwater, they begin to multiply and expand into larger structures - which we know as coral reefs. These reefs are primarily built of the polyps’ calcium carbonate exoskeletons, but parts of other organisms like the shells of coralline algae and spicules of sponges become part of the ecosystem’s foundational structure as these organisms settle on the reef. Coral reefs typically grow in one of three patterns: fringing, atoll, or barrier. Fringing reefs are the most common, and they grow from the shoreline to the water. Atoll reefs grow from underwater volcanic islands, and they’re usually circular with a lagoon at their centers. Barrier reefs border shorelines but they don’t directly touch the shore like a fringing reef; rather, there is often a lagoon separating the land from the barrier reef.</p>
                <p>Due to a number of environmental issues, coral reefs have been in decline for over half a century. According to the reef conservation group Secore, more than 50% of the world’s coral reefs have died in the past three decades alone, and it’s very unlikely that this trend will stop anytime soon.</p>
                <p>Coral reefs are being damaged by multiple factors:</p>
                <p>Man-caused damage: This includes coastal construction, careless fishing procedures, dredging, boat anchors, and touching or breaking coral by use of hands.</p>
                <p>Pollution: This is most often pollution that transfers from land to water - sedimentation from agriculture, excess nutrients from fertilizers, pathogens from sewage, toxic materials from chemicals and pesticides, trash and microplastics. </p>
                <p>Overfishing: Excessive fishing causes imbalances in marine ecosystems, including removing fish that are responsible for cleaning algae off of coral reefs for optimal growth. </p>
                <p>Coral harvesting: Harvesting coral for commercial purposes (jewelry, souvenirs, etc) destroys reef habitats.</p>
                <p>Ocean acidification: This is an effect of climate change where increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes more carbonic acid to form in oceans, which increases their acidification. Increased acidity slows down formation of coral reefs, even dissolving them in severe cases.
                    Increasing sea surface temperatures: Climate change also raises the temperature of sea surfaces. When coral reefs are exposed to these higher temperatures, they lose the algae that give the reefs their nutrition and color. This process is called “bleaching”, and frequent bleaching over time (which is inevitable due to climate change) means that the coral can’t recover from losing its nutrients and can even die off. </p>
                <p>The decline of coral reefs will harm animals that depend on its complex ecosystems for survival - and with about ¼ of all marine life falling into that category, that doesn’t spell good things for the ocean. Coral reefs also act as natural barriers that shield shorelines from natural disasters. They can absorb from 70%-90% of wave impact. With damaged and dying reefs, coastlines will suffer more severe effects from storms. Declining coral reefs also decrease the absorption of carbon dioxide by the ocean, which accelerates the effects of climate change.</p>
                <div>Discussion Questions:
                    <li>1. What are coral reefs? How do they form?</li>
                    <li>2. Why are reefs important to the environment?</li>
                    <li>3. Name three causes of the ongoing coral decline.</li>
