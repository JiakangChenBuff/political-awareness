                <p>If you pay attention to the news, you’ve probably heard the word “anarchist” a whole bunch lately. But honestly? I doubt any of America’s mainstream politicians have used “anarchist” correctly in their speeches this year. 
                    So what exactly are anarchists? What is anarchism? 
                    Anarchists, in the words of the Anarchist Library Organization, are basically “anti-authoritarians”. Although different types of anarchy focus on different topics such as evolution, pacifism, or religion, their ideology is based around questioning ‘irrational authority’. What’s that? Let’s look at the meaning of that term. </p>
                <p>Anarchists focus on the difference between having authority and being authority. To be an authority, you have to be experienced in your field. As an authority, you can be trusted to give advice on what you’re competent in. This is authority that forms from logical reasoning - you are good in this subject, so you’re qualified to give advice on it. People are free to ignore what you say, of course, but you’re there to help and guide them whenever needed. That’s rational authority. 
                    Anyone can have authority, but that doesn’t mean they deserve it. Having authority means that you take the position of the commander in order to command people under you. You can be the least competent person in what you do, and yet if you are in a position of power (like a boss), you still have that authority. You’re not an authority, but you’ve got the position and the ranking to command those under you however you please. That’s irrational authority.</p>
                <p>
                    One example of irrational authority would be any sort of hierarchy. In a hierarchy, there’s always people above you who’re going to push down on you. Unless you’re at the very top, it’d be in your best interest to obey whatever the upper class says, because otherwise you would be punished - prison, a criminal record, and so on. Because you’re held in obedience by this threat of negative effects, you’re not actually acknowledging the authority because they are qualified in what they do. You’re obeying them because they have the power to give you orders and impose laws, and punish you if you don’t follow them. That’s why anarchists see any hierarchy as irrational.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    You see the “state” talked about a lot in anarchist philosophy, too. It’s not talking about a specific state, like California or Oregon or New York, though. The “state” just means a centralized government which uses force, violence, and hierarchy to enforce its authority...so any country’s government, essentially. The “state” is always considered irrational authority among anarchists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What are some key concepts in anarchism? Let’s take a look at the ones listed by the Anarchist Library:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anti-authoritarianism: anarchists focus on questioning irrational authority and destroying any form of hierarchy in society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Free association: people should have the freedom to associate and disassociate with whomever they choose at any time, instead of being forced to interact with certain groups of people out of irrational authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mutual aid: anarchists believe that people should lend aid and voluntary help to one another without a motive to conquer or rise in rank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Freedom: this one is pretty simple! Freedom is just the capability to control your own life, instead of being instructed by irrational authority. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Self management: in society, people’s governance should be formed from equal say instead of handing certain individuals authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Egalitarianism (total equality): “Egalitarianism” is just a fancy word for total equality. But this isn’t your average YA-novel dystopian “equality” where everyone is forced to be the exact clone of one another. Anarchists believe that egalitarianism comes from destroying wealth and power inequality, which is brought about by bringing down hierarchy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feminism: All anarchists advocate for gender equality. And I mean all. It’s really the bare minimum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s obviously no push for you to agree with anarchism, of course! But it would be useful to know the correct definition when you hear our politicians talk about “anarchists and looters”, right? Anarchy isn’t just a general term to be thrown around. It describes a complex philosophy that has, and will, continue to influence the world as we know it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discussion:
<p> 1. What is the difference between rational and irrational authority?</p>
<p>2. Do you agree with any of the key concepts of anarchy, if any? Why?</p>
