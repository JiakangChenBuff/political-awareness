                <p>Up to now, India is documented to have a 1.9% vaccination rate. This proved to be devastating news for India when the first strain of B.1.617 was uncovered in Maharashtra, India on October 5, 2020. B.1.617, sometimes referred to as the ‘Double Mutant,’ is a novel variant of Covid-19. In the media, B.1.617 dubbed as the ‘Double Mutant,’ because it has developed into two more main types of mutations. However, while there are two main types, there are a sum of 13 smaller mutations as of now.</p>
                <p>Worldwide, B.1.617 has become notorious for being responsible for the fastest surge of Covid-19 cases in India. In accordance, hospital space has become ever more valuable as it wanes, often resulting with overfilled hospitals. Perhaps this sign was the prelude to a record of 390,000 B.1.617 cases. Furthermore, in conformity with The Wall Street Journal, the B.1.617 variant has become the cause of over 3,600 deaths. This is partially due to the fact that B.1.617 is known for having a higher chance of dodging the defences of our immune systems, at least according to NPR. Ravi Gupta of Cambridge University has also mentioned the notion that our current vaccines are less competent on the new variant compared to previous strains. With all this in mind, it doesn’t come as a surprise to discover that B.1.617 has already become the dominant variant in India. In fact, pursuant to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, as of January to March of 2021, at least 60% of the cases in the Indian state of Maharashtra were of the new mutant variety. There was even worse news for the whole country. For them, by March 25, a staggering 70.4% of the collected Covid samples were B.1.617.</p>
                <p>As with the nature of the virus, B.1.617 has extended elsewhere. For example, several cases unfurled in the U.S., U.K., South Africa, and China. In total, by April 2021, at least 21 countries were already hit. This rapid surge has led numerous nations to ban the incoming travel from India. This regulation applies to the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany, and France. Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, have gone to the degree to begin threatening to jail or heavily fine travelers from India.</p>
                <p>While Covid-19 is indeed alleviating in many places, it is still actively participating and mutating in many countries. Thus, it would be advised to stay keen for the health of yourself and those around you. Help by spreading awareness and reminding your friends and family to stay alert and follow professionally set health procedures. Stay safe. Stay healthy.</p>
