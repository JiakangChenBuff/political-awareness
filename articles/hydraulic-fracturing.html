                <p>Have you ever wondered where the oil in your car comes from? No, not just the gas station - where does that oil really come from? And how is it obtained? One way that companies mine oil and gas is through fracking. “Fracking”, or hydraulic fracturing, is used to harvest fossil fuels that are trapped inside sedimentary rocks. </p>
                <p>In hydraulic fracturing, a deep well is drilled into the ground. Steel pipes with holes, called casings, are inserted into the well. Fracking fluid is then blasted through these holes. The high pressures created from the pumping of fracking fluid “fractures” the rock to gain access to the trapped oil and gas. Fracking uses equipment like fluid pumps, blenders to mix the fracking fluid, and storage units for different parts of the fluid (water, chemicals, and sand). </p>
                <p>You might think that fracking is a fast way of harvesting fuel that benefits the economy - and you’d be right! Fracking has helped lower costs of oil and provide people with better access to energy. However, it has other not-so-great effects on both the environment and us. According to the United States Geological Survey, one fracking well can use from 1.5 million to 16 million gallons of water. This amount continues to increase - a study from Duke University suggests that between 2011 and 2016, the amount of water used per fracking well grew by a lot. In West Texas, it increased by up to 770%! </p>
                <p>Fracking also contaminates the environment. It can pollute drinking water sources through fracking fluid leakage, weak well structure, and drilling mistakes. In addition to producing methane, fracking adds to air pollution by releasing toxic gases that have been linked to lung and heart damage, birth defects, cancer, and neurological problems. Workers on-site during fracking operations are at higher risk because they are closest to the toxic gases released.</p>
                <p>People living near fracking sites can be in danger from its effects on fault lines. The United States Geological Survey has found a correlation between disposal wells, used in oil and gas operations like fracking, and the increasing frequency of earthquakes in the central United States. This is because the massive amounts of pressure produced during fracking can also shift fault lines to cause earthquakes. </p>
                <p>
                    While fracking is effective for mining fossil fuels, its negative effects have made it a topic of discussion in the United States. Many people believe that fracking should be restricted, or even banned, because of how harmful it is to the environment. Others argue that its benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Despite the debate that surrounds it, hydraulic fracturing has definitely impacted the United States in irreversible ways.

                    <p>1. What did you learn from this article?</p>
                    <p>2. What do you think about fracking? Is it overall a good operation to continue? Or do its negative effects outweigh the advantages?
