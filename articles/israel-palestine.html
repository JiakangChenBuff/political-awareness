<p>When the UN Plan of 1948 declared Israel for Jewish and Palestine for Arabs, the Jewish accepted the idea and recognized the independence of Israel. However, the Arabs rejected the plan. They saw it as European colonialism. Then they declared war on Israel. Unexpectedly, Israel triumphed in the war. With the benefits of victory, Israel even extended its boundaries past those from the original UN plan. A ceasefire, also known as the “Green Line,” line was set. Additionally, Jordan had taken parts of Palestine during the war, including Jerusalem’s Old City—the holy city for many religions. This part conquered by Jordan became known as the West Bank. </p>
<p>In 1967, Israel declared another war, which became known as the Six-Day War. As the name suggests the war ended fast. However, Israel entirely altered the Green Line and subjugated the West Bank. Then, Israel’s move to annex Jerusalem to itself pulled it to the center of dispute. Israel identified Jerusalem as “Unified Jerusalem '' and its new capital. Many Jewish civilians viewed it as a religious victory. The West Bank was a destination with long Jewish history and profound biblical significance. It was also home to the holy sites of Judea and Samaria. </p>
<p>Naturally, the newly conquered Palestinians were vehemently upset with the new order. Israel, who was well aware of this, tried to preempt a Palestinian state independence by initiating a firm Jewish occupancy in East Jerusalem. To do this, Israel subsidized the building of 12 vast settlements in East Palestine. By 1977s, there were 38 settlements. Israel then encouraged Jewish settlers by establishing financial motivation. The settlements were well built and funded. In fact, one-third of all Jewish settlers migrated for monetary reasons. Additionally, there were the individual settlers whose objective for leaving was religious significance. All in all, it ended with an exodus of Jews who left to encroach the West Bank. </p>
Numerous countries denounced this migration, including the UN. The UN soon published a resolution, fundamentally communicating that the settlements were illicit and would disturb the Middle East’s collaborative peace. Despite the UN’s denouncement, the West Bank’s Jewish population grew. Palestinians abhorred what they saw as an obtrusion. Unrest became common. A prime example would be the 1929 incident in which the Arabs massacred Jews.</p>
<p>Then, in the 1990’s Bill Clinton of America, Prime Minister Yizhak Rabin of Israel, and Yasser Arafat of Palestine agreed upon the Oslo Accords, which initiated a Palestinian government and split West Bank in to three regions. The first type of type of region, Area A, allowed total Palestinian rule over governmental and security related business. In other words, the regions that were considered Area A were allowed to self-govern. An approximate 18% of the West Bank is composed of Area A. This is where bulk of the Palestinian population resides. The second type of government, Area B, is only authorized to have governmental control over its population. In this type, Israel took on security control, namely military control. This comprises 21% of the West Bank. The last type of government, Area C, is entirely under Israel’s military and governmental control. This made up 60% of the West Bank. This 60% is where most of the people, by means most of the Jewish, and natural resources reside. </p>
<p>Most notably, Area C is where most of the minerals, agricultural regions, water, and other natural resources lay. However, since Area C is entirely under Israel’s authority, and many Palestinian companies were forced to follow strict restrictions and guidelines in order to retrieve the natural resources, resulting in a severe hit to the Palestinian economy.</p>
<p>In 2005, an important mark in Israeli history, Israel’s Prime Minister Ariel Sharon evicted at least 9000 settlers, 25 settlements, from the Gaza Strip, another Palestinian territory. This ejection stimulated the rise of settler migration to the West Bank. In fact, so many Israelis migrated to the West Bank that 5% of the entire Israel population now resides in the West Bank. Palestinian animosity has grown over years over their disadvantages and forced annexation. In recent days, this friction has reignited and has been shown through the forms of bombing and protests.</p>
