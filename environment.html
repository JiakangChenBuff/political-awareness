                        <div class='article-description'> Have you ever wondered where the oil in your car comes from? No, not just the gas station - where does that oil really come from? And how is it obtained? One way that companies mine oil and gas is through fracking. “Fracking”, or hydraulic fracturing, is used to harvest fossil fuels that are trapped inside sedimentary rocks.  </div>

                        <div class='article-description'> If you’ve ever been to the zoo, it’s more than likely that you’ve seen many animals that could once only be found across the world. Think rhinos, elephants, tigers, leopards, sea turtles, and even orangutans! Although they’re fun to watch and learn about from behind the glass exhibition window, these animals share a tragic fact: they’re all victims of poaching, a dangerous and illegal activity that threatens the wellbeing of animals across the planet.
                    What is poaching? Poaching is the illegal hunting of wild animals, often for either sport or market demand. It’s estimated by the Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network, TRAFFIC, that the trade resulting from poaching is likely worth billions of dollars. The World Bank takes this approximation further and sets it at a range of 5-23 billion dollars per year. It’s no minor matter. About 60% of elephants face their deaths at the hands of poachers - which isn’t a surprise, given the statistic that ivory hunters kill about 96 elephants daily in Africa. In South Africa alone, where the largest population of rhinos in the world reside, there was a 9000% increase in poaching between 2007 and 2014. That’s about 90 times the original rate in 2007.</div>

                        <div class='article-description'> Have you ever been scuba diving? From personal experience, I think it’s pretty breathtaking (quite literally if you inhale the saltwater) and definitely worth a shot if you ever get the chance after lockdown. In addition to the fish, scuttling crabs, and lumbering turtles, you can also view one of the ocean’s greatest masterpieces while scuba diving: coral reefs. They’re colorful, beautiful, home to thousands of tiny animals - and also dying more and more by the year. </div>
